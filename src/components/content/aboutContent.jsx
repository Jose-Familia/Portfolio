      Hello, my name is Jose Rene Familia. I am a Systems Engineering student at APEC University (UNAPEC) in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

      About two years ago, I started getting interested in programming and its various areas, but the one that caught my attention the most was web programming. Since then, I have been studying and learning everything that I consider useful in this field. However, with so many technologies available, it is difficult to choose just one, as each technology is unique and has multiple applications. Therefore, I decided to learn several technologies, focusing mainly on frontend development.
